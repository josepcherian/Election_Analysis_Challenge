Using Python for Election Analysis Challenge


## Overview of Election Audit
For the Analysis we have to calculate the total number of vote cast.Get the complete list of county votes and calculate the total number of votes by the county. Also determined the county with the laregst number of voter turnout 
List out the candidate who were participated the election and the total number of votes for each candidates received. Determined the winner of the election which held and percentage of vote for each candidate

Total votes for the Colorado Board of Elections was 369,711, Denver County had the highest voter turnout, and the winner of the election is Diana DeGette with 272,892 votes with a majority of 73.8% of all votes, popular majority criteria of greater than or equal to 50.1%. 
 
## Summary of the election audit 
The winner had a supermajority, but the criteria was for a popular vote, greater than or equal to 50.1%.  This script could be easily modified to run a check for a supermajority, greater than or equal to 66.7% of the votes as the election criteria.  
A second way to change the code, with the county data, weights could be assigned to the counties to represent the weights of the electoral college votes.  With these 2 changes to the script, perhaps the election commission would consider a business proposal to make these two adjustments, and the script could calculate almost any election.
